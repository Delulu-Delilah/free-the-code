# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve this PSA site!

## Local Setup
- Open `index.html` directly or serve the folder with any static server.
- Edits live in `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.

## Coding Guidelines
- Accessibility first: keep semantic tags, ARIA, and keyboard support intact
- No inline styles; put styles in `styles.css`
- Prefer descriptive names and consistent formatting (.editorconfig provided)
- Keep sections with unique `id` values for anchors

## Commit Style
- Use clear, imperative messages, e.g. `feat: add Good Actors section`
- Group unrelated changes into separate commits

## Where to put things
- Images → `assets/images/`
- Icons / favicons → `assets/icons/`
- Docs → `docs/`

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
2. Make your changes and test locally
3. Open a PR with a short description and screenshots if visual
